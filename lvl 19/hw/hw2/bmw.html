        <img src="bmw.jpg" height="200">
        <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational conglomerate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. In 1922, the name and assets of Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (formerly Rapp Motorenwerke) were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), thereby giving rise to the company known today as BMW AG.[5][6]
            <br>The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles are marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles, and the 6th largest by revenue,[7] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[8] In 2023, the company was ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[9] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.
            <br>BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in 2023).[10] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959, saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.</p>

        <img src="BMW_G70_740d_1X7A7230.jpg" height="200">
        <p>G70 is the internal designation for the seventh generation of the BMW 7 Series, a range of luxury cars produced by the German luxury vehicle manufacturer BMW since July 2022.[1]
            <br>Introduced in April 2022,[7] "7 Series" and "i7" serve as the respective designations to the automaker's full-size luxury flagship models in internal combustion and battery electric configurations. BMW had unveiled the model on 20 April 2022 during the nameplate's 45th anniversary.[8] Sold onwards as a 2023 model,[9] it is longer than its predecessor model. This model offers petrol and diesel models, come standard with a 48-volt mild hybrid powertrain; a plug-in hybrid system is available.[10] The seventh-generation BMW 7 Series is often collectively referred to as the G70.
            <br>The G70 commenced production on 1 July 2022, exactly seven years after the previous model.[11] The i7 is the first 7 Series to offer a fully electric powertrain, which shares powertrains with the smaller G60 i5. Both 7 Series and i7 offer optional rear- or all-wheel drive drivetrains.[12] The V12 model is no longer offered, instead gets replaced by the M760e plug-in hybrid.</p>

            <br>
        <p>The BMW i7 model is the battery electric variant of the G70.[60] Unveiled simultaneously with its ICE counterpart,[61] the vehicle features a similar powertrain setup to the iX crossover SUV: an excited synchronous electric motor at the rear on rear-wheel drive models and a motor at both front and rear axles on all-wheel drive models.[62] These models are built upon a 400 V battery architecture. The i7 is the only model to be available with the Executive Lounge package. These models are built at the same assembly line in Dingolfing has the internal combustion models, as well as its E-segment counterpart.[63]
            <br>The models are fitted with BMW's in-house electric motors, seen on the I20 iX and the G60 i5. The i7's gross and usable battery capacities are 105.7 kWh and 101.7 kWh, respectively.[64][65][66] The lithium-ion units have a battery voltage of 376.4 V, producing an all-electric range of up to 625 km (388 mi).[64] The single-motor eDrive50, which was introduced in May 2023 as the entry-level i7, features BMW's eDrive which produces an output of 335 kW (449 hp) and 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft). Its estimated all-electric range is 575–611 km (357–380 mi) at a WLTP standard.[67] The xDrive60 features dual eDrive motors which produce a combined output of 400 kW (540 hp) and 745 N⋅m (549 lbf⋅ft).[68] All-electric driving ranges from 591–625 km (367–388 mi).[69] The range-topping M70 xDrive model features dual eDrive motors that produce a combined output of 485 kW (650 hp) and 1,100 N⋅m (811 lbf⋅ft).</p>
