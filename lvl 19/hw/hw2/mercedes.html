        <h1>About the brand Mercedes</h1>
        <img src="Mercedes-Benz_Logo_2010.svg.webp" height="100" width="400">
        <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG),[4] trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational conglomerate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. In 1922, the name and assets of Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (formerly Rapp Motorenwerke) were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), thereby giving rise to the company known today as BMW AG.[5][6]
            <br>The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles are marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles, and the 6th largest by revenue,[7] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[8] In 2023, the company was ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[9] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.
            <br>BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in 2023).[10] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959, saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.</p>

        <h2>Mercedes-Benz GLE</h2>
        <img src="mercedes-gle-53-0084.jpg" height="200">
        <p>This is the Mercedes-Benz GLE, only the second Mercedes SUV to wear the name but in fact the latest in a line of successful Benz 4x4s that trace their roots back to the M-Class of 1997. Mercedes proudly says it invented the premium SUV class, but conveniently ignores the BMW X5 and Volvo XC90 making a better fist of it in the intervening couple of decades.
            <br>That might not be the case any longer, though – launched in 2019, the Mk2 GLE is a very complete car. An 80mm stretch in the wheelbase over the old version carved out enough room for seven seats; a first-time feature in the GLE. In fact, the interior as a whole is one of the leaps over the previous GLE, resplendent with its massive twin 12.3in screens and general air of solidity.
            <br>An update to the GLE in 2023 introduced a host of new features: the grille, air intakes and headlights were freshened up and inside there was a new steering wheel, Merc’s latest MBUX infotainment system and a fancy Burmester sound system. Air suspension and hybrid tech is now standard too: buy a GLE and it will be a mild-hybrid at the very least, or a full PHEV if you part with enough money.
            <br>Oh, and if you’re looking for something to rival the BMW X6, Mercedes also offers the GLE in chopped-roof Coupe form.</p>

        <p>Under the bonnet, the GLE depends on Mercedes' latest family of engines, which means once you’re beyond the four-cylinder GLE 300d (265bhp, 406lb ft), it’s straight sixes, not V6s, that do the work. And good though the four-pot is, it’s the larger 3.0-litres (there’s a petrol and a diesel) you really want. They suit the GLE to a tee, and once you do the maths on the extra equipment brought along with it, they become more of a no-brainer.
            <br>All GLEs are all-wheel drive and feature nine-speed automatic gearboxes. The impressive GLE 450 (376bhp, 369lb ft) and 450d (362bhp, 553lb ft) straight sixes are supplemented by a 48-volt electric power bump, branded by Mercedes as EQ Boost. It makes stop-starting the engine a freakishly smooth affair, harvests energy when coasting, and adds a 20bhp helping hand to fill in for turbo lag. As such, both will blast through the 0-62mph sprint in 5.6 seconds. Mercedes even fits this system to the mad, mighty GLE 63 S. Yep, that’s the one with a 604bhp V8. With twin turbos. Hits 0-62mph in less than four seconds…</p>
