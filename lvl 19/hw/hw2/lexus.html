        <h1>About the Lexus brand</h1>
        <img src="lexus.jpg" height="200">
        <p><b>Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu)</b> is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide[3][6] and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value.[7] Lexus has been headquartered in Shimoyama, Aichi, in Japan since 2024.[8] Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.
            <br>Created about the same time that Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and Infiniti luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989.[9] Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.</p>
