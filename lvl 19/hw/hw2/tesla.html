        <h1>About Tesla inc.</h1>
        <img src="tesla.webp" height="200">
        <p>Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.
            <br>Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla's first funding round and became the company's chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.
            <br>Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024[5] and February 2025.[6] In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[7]</p>
    
        <h2>2025 Tesla Model X</h2>
        <img src="tesla-model-x-6734b3d48460d.jpg" height="200">
        <br><p>Slotting in above the Model Y, the Model X is Tesla’s larger luxury EV SUV. It’s built off of the same platform as the long-running Model S sedan and offers the same choice of powertrains: one that’s merely powerful and one that’s delightfully overpowered. The X adds an available third row of seats that brings capacity from five passengers to either six or seven, with rows two and three accessed by a pair of supercar-style gull-wing doors that Tesla calls falcon-wing doors. Power maxes out at 1020 horsepower in the Plaid, while the standard All-Wheel Drive model boasts 670 horses. Still, the X’s interior is not nearly as stirring as its power and range, with a subdued design and materials that feel out of place in a supposed luxury vehicle with prices over $100k for the top model.</p>
        <br><p>he Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV,[4] and shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S, half of the originally planned 60 percent, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X and Model S are produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California, on February 9, 2012.[8][9] First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.[10] After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling plug-in cars.[11] A refresh of the Tesla Model X was introduced in 2021, offering a new "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.[12]Another update of the Model X was introduced in June 2025 with a new front bumper camera, new wheel designs, increased third-row space, dynamic ambient lighting, and adaptive headlights.[13] The updates are similar to the Model S, which was updated at the same time.</p>
