            <h2 id="parrot">Grey parrot</h2>
            <img src="gray-parrot-psittacus-erithacus.jpg.webp" height="200">
            <p><b>The grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus)</b>, also known as the Congo grey parrot, is an African parrot in the family Psittacidae. It was previously also known as the African grey parrot until the Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh), previously treated as a subspecies, was elevated to a full species.</p>
            <p>The grey parrot is native to equatorial Africa, including Angola, Cameroon, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. The species is found inside a range from Kenya to the eastern part of Ivory Coast.[12][13] Current estimates for the global population are uncertain and range from 630,000 to 13 million birds. Populations are decreasing worldwide.[13] The species seems to favour dense forests, but can also be found at forest edges and in more open vegetation types, such as gallery and savanna forests.[1]
                A population study published in 2015 found that the species had been "virtually eliminated" from Ghana with numbers declining 90 to 99% since 1992.[14] They were found in only 10 of 42 forested areas, and three roosts that once held 700–1200 birds each, now had only 18 in total. Local people mainly blamed the pet trade and the felling of timber for the decline.[15] Populations are thought to be stable in Cameroon. In the Congo, an estimated 15,000 are taken every year for the pet trade, from the eastern part of the country, although the annual quota is stated to be 5,000.[15]
                The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission indicated they have observed grey parrots escaped or released into South Florida since at least 1984, but no evidence indicates that the population is breeding naturally.</p>

            <p>Little is known about the behaviour and activities of these birds in the wild. In addition to a lack of research funding, it can be particularly difficult to study these birds in wild situations due to their status as prey animals, which leads them to have rather secretive personalities. It has been shown that wild grey parrots may also imitate a wide variety of sounds they hear, much like their captive relatives. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, two greys sound-recorded while roosting reportedly had a repertoire of over 200 different calls, including nine imitations of other wild bird songs and one of a bat.
                Grey parrots are mainly frugivorous, with most of their diet consisting of <b>fruit, nuts, and seeds, including oil palm fruit. They sometimes also eat flowers and tree bark, as well as insects and snails.[18] In the wild, the grey parrot is partly a ground feeder</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Grey parrots are <i>monogamous breeders who nest in tree cavities</i>. Each mated pair of parrots needs their own tree for their nest. The hen lays three to five eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. The adults defend their nesting sites.[12]
                Grey parrot chicks require feeding and care from their parents in the nest.[12] The parents take care of them until 4–5 weeks after they are fledged.[20] Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behaviour of this species in the wild.</p>

            <p>Natural predators for this species include palm-nut vultures and several raptors. Monkeys target eggs and the young for food.[12]
                <b><em>Humans are by far the largest threat to wild grey populations.</em></b> Between 1994 and 2003, more than 359,000 grey parrots were traded on the international market. Approximately 21% of the wild population was being harvested every year. Mortality rates are extremely high between the time they are captured and they reach the market, ranging from 60 to 66%.[13][21] This species also is hunted for its meat and for its body parts, which are used in traditional medicines.[22] As a result of the extensive harvest of wild birds, in addition to habitat loss, this species is believed to be undergoing a rapid decline in the wild and therefore, has been rated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[1]
                In October 2016, the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Fauna and Flora (CITES) extended the highest level of protection to grey parrots by listing the species under Appendix 1, which regulates international trade in the species.[23]
                In 2021, the Kenyan government held a short amnesty, during which grey parrot owners could pay a fee to obtain a permit for their birds and facilitate legal ownership. Following the expiry of this time period, it is now illegal to own this species without a permit</p>

            <h2 id="crow"> New Caledonian crow</h2>
            <img src="new-caledonian-crow-handling-twig.jpg.webp" height="200">

            <p><strong>The New Caledonian crow </strong>(Corvus moneduloides) is a medium-sized member of the family Corvidae, native to New Caledonia. The bird is often referred to as the 'qua-qua' due to its distinctive call. It eats a wide range of food, including many types of invertebrates, eggs, nestlings, small mammals, snails, nuts and seeds. The New Caledonian crow sometimes captures grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached. This method of feeding indicates the New Caledonian crow is capable of tool use. They are also able to make hooks.[2] This species is also capable of solving a number of sophisticated cognitive tests which suggest that it is particularly intelligent.[3][4][5] As a result of these findings, the New Caledonian crow has become a model species for scientists trying to understand <strong>the impact of tool use and manufacture on the evolution of intelligence.</strong></p>
            <p>The New Caledonian crow eats a wide range of food, including many types of insects and other invertebrates (some caught in flight with great agility, including night-flying insects which it catches at dusk), eggs and nestlings, small mammals, snails (which it drops from a height onto hard stones), and various nuts and seeds.
                This species is known for using plant material to create stick and leaf tools to capture prey hiding in cracks and crevices. These tools can have naturally occurring barbs, or are sometimes fashioned into hooks by the birds. The tool is inserted into the crack or crevice in the log or branch, and the prey is agitated into biting the tool. The crow then withdraws the tool with prey still attached, and devours the prey. Grubs caught in this way have been shown to be an integral part of the crows' diet.[7] The New Caledonian crow appears to fill the ecological niche of the woodpeckers and the woodpecker finch of the Galapagos, since the latter and New Caledonia lack woodpeckers. The feeding method of the woodpecker finch differs in that it stabs at grubs and levers them slowly out of the log using a small twig.
                The nest of the New Caledonian crow is built high in a tree with usually 2–3 eggs laid from September to November.</p>

                <p>This species uses stick tools in the wild by finding small twigs and probing them into holes in logs to extract insects and larvae.[2] New Caledonian crows are also able to manufacture tools by breaking twigs off bushes and trimming them to produce functional stick tools.[2] Tool manufacture is rare in comparison to simple tool use and indicates a higher level of cognitive function. The crows can also make leaf tools by tearing rectangular strips off the edges of Pandanus spp. leaves.[8] The creation of such leaf tools allows these crows to exploit naturally occurring hooks – the barbs running along the edges of these leaves can be used as hooks if the tool is held such that the barbs point towards the crows’ head. Other naturally occurring hooks are also incorporated within tools, such as the thorns that grow on vine species in New Caledonia.[8] These crows create hooks by crafting both wood and ferns into hooks.[8] This is done by trimming the junctions between two branches or fern stolons into a tick shape (i.e. one junction has a long piece of wood/stolon attached, one junction has a small piece of wood /stolon attached) and then removing material from this junction to create a functioning hook. This imposition of three-dimensional form onto a natural material resembles carving.[citation needed]
                This species has a particular method for crafting tools:
                Crows snip into the leaf edges and then tear out neat strips of vegetation with which they can probe insect-harboring crevices. These tools have been observed to come in three types: narrow strips, wide strips and multi-stepped strips—which are wide at one end and, via a manufacturing process that involves stepwise snips and tears, become narrow at the opposite end.[9]
                The New Caledonian crow is the only non-primate species for which there is evidence of cumulative cultural evolution in tool manufacture. That is, this species appear to have invented new tools by modifying existing ones, then passing these innovations to other individuals in the cultural group. Gavin R. Hunt and colleagues at the University of Auckland studied tools the crows make out of pandanus (or screw pine) leaves. Observations of the distribution of 5,500 leaf counterparts or stencils left behind by the cutting process suggest that the narrow and the stepped tools are more advanced versions of the wide tool type. "The geographical distribution of each tool type on the island suggests a unique origin, rather than multiple independent inventions". This implies that the inventions, which involve a delicate change in the manufacturing process, were being passed from one individual to another.[8]
                The New Caledonian crow also spontaneously makes tools from materials it does not encounter in the wild. In 2002, researcher Alex Kacelnik and colleagues at the University of Oxford observed of a couple of New Caledonian crows called Betty and Abel:
                Betty's toolmaking abilities came to light by accident during an experiment in which she and Abel had to choose between a hooked and a straight wire for retrieving small pieces of pig heart, their favorite food. When Abel made off with the hooked wire, Betty bent the straight wire into a hook and used the tool to lift a small bucket of food from a vertical pipe. This experiment was the first time the crows had been presented with wire.[10]
                This observation was further investigated in a series of studies. Out of ten successful retrievals, Betty bent the wire into a hook nine times. Abel retrieved the food once, without bending the wire.[3] The process would usually start with Betty trying to get the food bucket with the straight wire, but then she would make a hook from it bending it in different ways, usually by snagging one end of the wire under something, and then using the bent hook to pick up the tray.
                Clearly, Betty's creation of hooks cannot be attributed to the shaping or reinforcement of trial-and-error behavior. In 2004, Hunt observed the crows in the wild also making hooks, but the adaptation to the new material of the wire was clearly novel and appeared purposeful. Intentional tool manufacture, even if it is generalizing a prior experience to a novel context, is rare in the animal world.
                <b>These crows also use tools to investigate potentially dangerous objects, such as a rubber snake or a flashing LED bike light.</b></p>

            <h2 id="raven"> northern raven</h2>
            <img src="common-raven-with-nesting-material.jpg.webp" height="200">

            <p><strong>The common raven or northern raven </strong>(Corvus corax) is a large all-black passerine bird. It is the most widely distributed of all corvids, found across the Northern Hemisphere. There are 11 accepted subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.47 kilograms (3.2 pounds) in weight, though up to 2 kg (4.4 lb) in the heaviest individuals. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.
                Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste. Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent.
                Over the centuries, the raven has been the subject of<b> mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.</b></p>

            <p><b>Owing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities</b>, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs and chicks include martens, large owls, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of large birds of prey taking ravens; more rarely, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce.
                In North America, predators of ravens have reportedly included great horned owls, American goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks. It is possible that the hawk species only attack young ravens; in one instance a peregrine falcon swooped at a newly fledged raven but was chased off by the parent ravens.[66][67][68][69] Ravens wary around novel carrion sites, and in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.[70]
                In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller's sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons.[71][72][73][74][75] Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens.</p>


            <p>Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for <b>another two or three years</b>. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence [citation needed], and ability to provide food are key behaviours of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location.[65] Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.[76]
                Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus they aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area.[31] The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks (up to 150 cm long and 2.5 cm thick[41]) and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.[77]</p>

            <h2 id="magpie">Eurasian magpie</h2>
            <img src="eurasian-magpie-pica-pica.jpg.webp" height="200">

            <p>The Eurasian magpie or common magpie (Pica pica) is a resident breeding bird throughout the northern part of the Eurasian continent. It is one of several birds in the crow family (corvids) designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of "monochrome" magpies. In Europe, "magpie" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the Eurasian magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki), which is limited to the Iberian Peninsula. Despite having a shared name and similar colouration, it is not closely related to the Australian magpie.
                The Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds.[2] The expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size as the brain of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans.[3] It is the only non-mammalian species known to pass the mirror test.</p>

            <p>he range of the magpie extends across temperate Eurasia from Portugal, Spain and Ireland in the west to the Kamchatka Peninsula.[19]
                The preferred habit is open countryside with scattered trees and magpies are normally absent from treeless areas and dense forests.[19] They sometimes breed at high densities in suburban settings such as parks and gardens.[22][23] They can often be found close to the centre of cities.[24]
                Magpies are normally sedentary and spend winters close to their nesting territories but birds living near the northern limit of their range in Sweden, Finland and Russia can move south in harsh weather.</p>

            <p>Some magpies breed after their first year, while others remain in <b>the non-breeding flocks</b> and first breed in their second year.[25] They are monogamous, and the pairs often remain together from one breeding season to the next. They generally occupy the same territory on successive years.[26]
                Mating takes place in spring. In the courtship display, males rapidly raise and depress their head feathers, uplift, open and close their tails like fans, and call in soft tones quite distinct from their usual chatter. The loose feathers of the flanks are brought over the primaries, and the shoulder patch is spread so the white is conspicuous, presumably to attract females. Short buoyant flights and chases follow.
                Magpies prefer tall trees for their bulky nest, firmly attaching them to a central fork in the upper branches. A framework of the sticks is cemented with earth and clay, and a lining of the same is covered with fine roots. Above is a stout though loosely built dome of prickly branches with a single well-concealed entrance. These huge nests are conspicuous when the leaves fall. Where trees are scarce, though even in well-wooded country, nests are at times built in bushes and hedgerows.
                In 2023, biologists discovered magpie nests made from anti-bird spikes.[27][28] A nest found in Antwerp (Belgium) now the collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center contains 1500 of these sharp metal spikes, made to deter birds. As they are placed in the dome of the nest to prevent predation of their chicks, they seem to be used in the same way they were intended to be used, to deter other birds.[29][30]
                In Europe, clutches are typically laid in April,[31] and usually contain five or six eggs, but clutches with as few as three and as many as ten have been recorded.[32] The eggs are laid in early morning, usually at daily intervals.[33] On average, the eggs of the nominate species measure 32.9 mm × 23 mm (1.30 in × 0.91 in) and weigh 9.9 g (0.35 oz).[33][34] Small for the size of the bird, they are typically pale blue-green, with close specks and spots of olive brown, but show much variation in ground and marking.[35]
                The eggs are incubated for 21–22 days by the female, who is fed on the nest by the male.[36] The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes. They are brooded by the female for the first 5–10 days and fed by both parents.[37] Initially the parents eat the faecal sacs of the nestlings, but as the chicks grow larger, they defecate on the edge of the nest.[38] The nestlings open their eyes 7 to 8 days after hatching. Their body feathers start to appear after around 8 days and the primary wing feathers after 10 days.[39] For several days before they are ready to leave the nest, the chicks clamber around the nearby branches.[40] They fledge at around 27 days.[39] The parents then continue to feed the chicks for several more weeks. They also protect the chicks from predators, as their ability to fly is poor, making them vulnerable.[39] On average, only 3 or 4 chicks survive to fledge successfully. Some nests are lost to predators, but an important factor causing nestling mortality is starvation. Magpie eggs hatch asynchronously, and if the parents have difficulty finding sufficient food, the last chicks to hatch are unlikely to survive.[41] Only a single brood is reared, unless disaster overtakes the first clutch.</p>

            <h2 id="kea">The kea</h2>
            <img src="kea-exploring-car.jpg.webp" height="200">
            <p><strong>The kea </strong>is a species of large parrot in the family Strigopidae[3] that is endemic to the forested and alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand.[4] About 48 cm (19 in) long, it is mostly olive-green, with brilliant orange under its wings, and has a large, narrow, curved, grey-brown upper beak. Its omnivorous diet consists mainly of roots, leaves, berries, nectar, and insects, but also includes carrion.[5] It was once killed for bounty due to concern by sheep farmers that it attacked livestock, especially sheep.[6] The kea is now uncommon, and received absolute protection under the Wildlife Act in 1986.[7]
                The kea nests in burrows or crevices among the roots of trees. Kea are known for their intelligence and curiosity, both vital to their survival in a harsh mountain environment. Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective.[8] They have been filmed preparing and using tools.</p>

            <p><em></em>The kea ranges from lowland river valleys and coastal forests of the South Island's west coast up to alpine regions of the South Island such as Arthur's Pass and Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. It is closely associated throughout its range with the southern beech (Nothofagus) forests in the alpine ridge.</em>
                Apart from occasional vagrants, kea today are not found in the North Island. Subfossil kea bones have been found in sand dunes at Mataikona in the eastern Wairarapa, Poukawa near Hastings, and Waitomo, indicating that they ranged through lowland forest over much of the North Island until the arrival of Polynesian settlers about 750 years ago.[29] Kea subfossils are not restricted to alpine areas, being commonly found in lowland or coastal sites in the South Island.[30] The current distribution of kea reflects the effects of mammalian predators, including humans, which have driven them out of lowland forests into the mountains</p>

            <p>Kea parrots have strong cognitive abilities. According to recent studies, kea share the ability to have sense of impulsive control and planning forward. Kea can wait up to 160 seconds for a more preferred reward. In addition, kea also use trial-and-error tactics and use observational learning to solve difficult problems and when tasked with puzzles and locks. These decision-making abilities are similar to primates and other intelligent bird species such as the African grey parrot.</p>

            <p>An omnivore, the kea feeds on more than <b>>40 plant species, beetle larvae, grasshoppers, land snails, other birds (including shearwater chicks), and mammals (including sheep, rabbits and mice)</b>.It has been observed breaking open shearwater nests to feed on the chicks after hearing the chicks in their nests.[43] It enjoys the flesh and bone marrow from carcasses.[42] The kea has also taken advantage of human garbage and "gifts" of food.[44]
                Tool use behaviour has been observed in this species, wherein a bird named Bruce, who has a broken upper beak, wedged pebbles between his tongue and lower mandible and then utilised this arrangement to aid with his preening habits</p>
