<!--1)We know bold, italic, underline, strong and emphasis text formatting tags-->

<!--2) bold- makes the text's shape darker and thicker
            italic- makes the text bend on the right side
            underline- underlines the text
            strong- same as bold except used for screen readers
            emphasis-same as italic except used for screen readers-->

<!--3)both are different from them because theyre used for screen readers to emphasize a certain text and theyre more important-->
