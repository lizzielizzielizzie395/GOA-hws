        <h3 id="isaac"><i>Isaac Newton (1643–1727)</i></h3>
        <img src="isaac1.jpg" height="300">
        <p>Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and natural philosopher, widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history. He laid the foundation for classical mechanics and <br>revolutionized mathematics and physics in the 17th century.
        Newton formulated the three fundamental laws of motion, which describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. These laws form the cornerstone of classical mechanics.<br>
        Newton proposed that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional <br>to the square of the distance between them. This was groundbreaking in uniting celestial and terrestrial physics.
        Although the development of calculus was<br> contested with Leibniz, Newton independently developed what he called "fluxions," which became integral to modern mathematics.<br>
        Newton conducted extensive work on light and color. He demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors and built the first practical<br>reflecting telescope (Newtonian telescope).
        <br>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), his magnum opus, commonly known as the Principia, laid out the laws of motion and <br>universal gravitation, forming the basis for much of classical physics.</p>

        <h3 id="rich"><i>Richard Feynman (1918–1988)</i></h3>
        <img src="feynman.jpg">
        <p>Richard P. Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, widely recognized for his work in quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics (QED), and particle physics. <br>He was also a charismatic teacher and a prominent figure in the development of the atomic bomb.
        <br>Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga for their independent and complementary work on QED.<br> Feynman’s formulation introduced Feynman diagrams, a visual tool to describe particle interactions.
        These diagrams revolutionized quantum field theory by offering an intuitive and computationally effective method for calculating interactions between particles.<br>
        Feynman reformulated quantum mechanics using the principle of least action, proposing that particles take all possible paths between two points—a key insight that<br> deepened our understanding of quantum behavior.
        He worked at Los Alamos on the atomic bomb during World War II, contributing to the theoretical side of the project.
        In 1986, Feynman famously demonstrated how the O-rings used in the space shuttle became brittle at low temperatures, revealing a key cause of the disaster.</p>

        <h3 id="carl"><i>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)</i></h3>
        <img src="gauss.jpg" height="250">
        <p>Carl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician and physicist often referred to as the “Prince of Mathematicians.” His work profoundly influenced many fields, including number theory, statistics, analysis, <br>differential geometry, geophysics, electrostatics, and astronomy.
        <br>His book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) systematized number theory and introduced concepts like modular arithmetic and quadratic reciprocity.
        <br>In statistics, the normal distribution is often called the Gaussian distribution in his honor, stemming from his work on the method of least squares and probability.
        <br>Gauss developed foundational ideas in magnetism, including Gauss's law for magnetism, which later became one of Maxwell’s equations.
        <br>He contributed to non-Euclidean geometry and proposed the idea of intrinsic curvature of surfaces.
        <br>Gauss made significant advances in orbit prediction and helped establish the mathematical basis for the method of least squares.<br> He also co-invented the heliotrope, an instrument used in geodetic surveys.</p>

        <h3 id="maxwell"><i>James Clerk Maxwell 1831–1879)</i></h3>
        <img src="maxwell.jpg">
        <p>James Clerk Maxwell was a Scottish physicist and mathematician best known for formulating the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, unifying electricity, magnetism,<br> and light into one framework.
        <br>Maxwell’s Equations: A set of four partial differential equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents. <br>These equations unified electricity, magnetism, and optics.
        <br>Maxwell predicted that light is an electromagnetic wave, moving through space at the speed of light. This insight laid the groundwork for modern physics and telecommunications.
        <br>He made vital contributions to statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases, introducing the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution that describes particle speeds in ideal gases.
        <br>Maxwell conducted pioneering work in color perception and created the first color photograph using the RGB (red-green-blue) method.</p>
